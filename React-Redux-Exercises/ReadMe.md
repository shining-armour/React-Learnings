# Key points

- The main goal of Redux is to make the state management of an application more predictable.
- State tree is an object that stores the entire state for an application at one location.
- 3-ways to interact with state tree -
  - Getting the state
  - Listening for changes to the state
  - Updating the state
- State tree + 3-ways to interact with State tree (GLU) = Store
- Pure functions characteristics -
  - Return the same result if the same arguments are passed in
  - Depend solely on the arguments passed into them
  - Do not produce side effects, such as API requests and I/O operations
- Reducer function characteristics -
  - Must be a pure function
  - Takes in current application state and action
  - Returns new state
- Dispatch function inside our store is responsible for updating the actual state of the store
- Dispatch works in the following way -
  - dispatch() is called with an Action
  - The reducer that was passed to createStore() is called with the current state tree and the action. This updates the state tree.
  - Because the state has (potentially) changed, all listener functions that have been registered with the subscribe() method are called
